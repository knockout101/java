/*
    - Use Quadratic probing strategy

    - need a node class that contains a keyword String and a LinkedList for storing articles for each keyword 

    - Read through the file counting the key words (assuming it is an ordered list of information)
        - use the number of keys to calculate the table size by multiplying it by 2 and finding the next prime number
    
    - Create HashMap of the table size by value constructor
        - assign the table size to the HashMap

    - Read file again for each article, collect the article information into an Article class
        - for each keyword make a node within the hash table using quadratic probing and add the article to the node's linked list
    
    - If there is a collision, using quadratic probing, find the next available index by adding an arbitrary value i squared

    - Search using quadratic probing, hash the node's keyword and find the next available using the same method as above

    - Displaying Articles by keyword will require searching, finding the keyword, then iterating over the linked list, displaying each article's information
