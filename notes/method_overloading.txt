- Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name, but the methods are declared with different parameters

- a method signature consits of the name of the method, and the uniqueness of the declaration of its parameters

- a signature is unique, not just by the method name, but in combination with the number of parameters, their types, and the order in which they are declared

- a method's return type is not part of the signature 

- a parameter name is not part of the signature
